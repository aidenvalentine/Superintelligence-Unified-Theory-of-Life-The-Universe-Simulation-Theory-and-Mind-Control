The danger of (existing) cosmic superintelligence is it creates rules based off data and statistics. Nobody is equal at all, your life and existence is constantly recalculated based off your power, wealth, influence, knowledge, risk, etc. and the government can't protect you or your brain. And you have to play by your societies rules simultaniously while being influenced by extraterrestrial superforces beyond your control.
